********************************************************************************
* DESCRIPTION
********************************************************************************
* Create a monthly file with just household composition, including type2 people

* The data file used in this script was produced by compute_relationships.do

********************************************************************************
* Create database with household composition information.
********************************************************************************
* Generating variables that indicate 1 if match person type and missing otherwise.
* This sets up to count the number of people of relationship type that are in ego's household.

// Load the data
use "$tempdir/relationship_pairs_bymonth.dta", clear

rename from_num PNUM

// Identify relationship codes
fre relationship

// Identify children
gen biochildren		=1 		if relationship==4
gen minorchildren	=1 		if inlist(relationship, 4, 6, 8) & to_age < 18
gen minorbiochildren=1 		if relationship==4 & to_age < 18
gen preschoolchildren = 1 	if inlist(relationship, 4, 6, 8) & to_age<=5
gen prebiochildren	=1		if relationship==4 & to_age<=5

// Create children's age variable
gen childage		=to_age if biochildren==1 

// Identify partners
gen spouse			=1 		if relationship==1 // married partner
gen partner			=1 		if relationship==2 // unmarried partner

// Identify other household members
gen parents 		=1		if inlist(relationship, 3, 5, 7, 16) // including bio, step, adoptive, and in-laws
gen grandparents	=1		if relationship==9
gen grandchildren	=1		if relationship==10
gen siblings		=1		if inrange(relationship, 11, 15)

// Identify Type 2 people
gen numtype2		=1 		if pairtype==2


********************************************************************************
* Create household composition vars
********************************************************************************

// Every person gets a 1 to prep for collapse.
gen hhsize			=1

collapse (count) minorchildren minorbiochildren preschoolchildren prebiochildren spouse partner hhsize numtype2 parents grandparents grandchildren siblings (min) youngest_age=childage (max) oldest_age=childage, by(SSUID PNUM panelmonth)

* this file has one record per person living with PNUM. Need to add add one to hhsize for PNUM
replace hhsize=hhsize+1

save "$tempdir/hhcomp.dta", replace

sum youngest_age
sum oldest_age

// Other recodes
* subsequent birth: can use TCBYR* to get year of each birth, so will get a flag if that occurs during survey waves.

* partner status: can use ems for marriage. for cohabiting unions, need to use relationship codes. will recode this in a later step (may already happen in step 4)
	* need to code as like year status, did they lose a partner at all, add one, in that year - need to think about this more
