Decomposition of Breadwinner predictors using the 1996 and 2014 SIPPs
================================================================================

The purpose of this analysis is to decompose differences in Breadwinner transitions over time into the composition of changes v. the effect of changes.
We use 3 changes: the mom experiencing an earnings change, someone else in the household experiencing an earnings change, or an earning leaving the household.

Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rate of transition into breadwinning in 1996 was <<dd_di: %9.2f $bw_rate_96 >>%.
The rate of transition into breadwinning in 2014 was <<dd_di: %9.2f $bw_rate_14 >>%.
This is a difference of <<dd_di: %9.2f $total_gap >>%.

Of the total <<dd_di: %9.2f $total_gap >>% difference, <<dd_di: %9.2f $rate_diff >>% can be explained by rate differences between the two surveys (rate of transition once you experienced the event).
Of the total <<dd_di: %9.2f $total_gap >>% difference, <<dd_di: %9.2f $comp_diff >>% can be explained by compositional differences between the two surveys (e.g. how many people experienced the events).

Further breaking down the gap:
<<dd_di: %9.2f $mom_component >>% could be attributed to the mother increasing component;
<<dd_di: %9.2f $partner_component >>% could be attributed to the partner decreasing component;
<<dd_di: %9.2f $other_hh_component >>% could be attributed to the other HH decreasing component;
<<dd_di: %9.2f $leaver_component >>% could be attributed to the earner leaving component.
