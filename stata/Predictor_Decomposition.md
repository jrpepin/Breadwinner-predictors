# Decomposition of Breadwinner predictors using the 1996 and 2014 SIPPs


The purpose of this analysis is to decompose differences in Breadwinner transitions over time into the composition of changes v. the effect of changes.
We use 3 changes: the mom experiencing an earnings change, someone else in the household experiencing an earnings change, or an earning leaving the household.

## Results


The rate of transition into breadwinning in 1996 was <<dd_di: %9.2f $bw_rate_96 >>%.
The rate of transition into breadwinning in 2014 was <<dd_di: %9.2f $bw_rate_14 >>%.
This is a difference of <<dd_di: %9.2f $total_gap >>%.

Of the total <<dd_di: %9.2f $total_gap >>% difference, <<dd_di: %9.2f $rate_diff >>% can be explained by rate differences between the two surveys (rate of transition once you experienced the event).
Of the total <<dd_di: %9.2f $total_gap >>% difference, <<dd_di: %9.2f $comp_diff >>% can be explained by compositional differences between the two surveys (e.g. how many people experienced the events).

Further breaking down the gap:
<<dd_di: %9.2f $mom_component >>% could be attributed to the mother increasing component;
<<dd_di: %9.2f $partner_component >>% could be attributed to the partner decreasing component;
<<dd_di: %9.2f $other_hh_component >>% could be attributed to the other HH decreasing component;
<<dd_di: %9.2f $leaver_component >>% could be attributed to the earner leaving component.
