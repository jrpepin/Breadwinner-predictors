* Note: I want to be able to capture negatives in this case, because we want the year prior to women bcoming a mother if she did in the panel. However, if she had her first baby in 2014, all her tcbyr's will be blank in the 2013 survey (since they only ask that question to parents) -- I need to copy the value of her yr of first birth to all nulls before then to get the appropriate calculation. example browse SSUID PNUM yrfirstbirth year tcbyr_1 if SSUID == "000114552134"

* Note that durmom=0 when child was born in this year, but some of the children born in the previous calendar
* year are still < 1. So if we want the percentage of mothers breadwinning in the year of the child's birth
* we should check to see if breadwinning is much different between durmom=0 or durmom=1. We could use durmom=1
* because many of those with durmom=0 will have spent much of the year not a mother. 

* also, some women gave birth to their first child after the reference year. In this case durmom < 0, but
* we don't have income information for this year in that wave of data. So, durmom < 0 is dropped below

* Variable recodes
********************************************************************************

* age of youngest child: needs to vary with time across the household, will compute once relationships updated. for any given month, identify all children in household, use TAGE and get min TAGE (file 04)

* # of preschool age children: will update this in future code with other HH compositon calculations (file 04)

* race/ ethnicity: combo of ERACE and EORIGIN
gen race=.
replace race=1 if erace==1 & eorigin==2
replace race=2 if erace==2 & eorigin==2
replace race=3 if erace==3 & eorigin==2
replace race=4 if eorigin==1
replace race=5 if erace==4 & eorigin==2

label define race 1 "NH White" 2 "NH Black" 3 "NH Asian" 4 "Hispanic" 5 "Other"
label values race race

drop erace eorigin

* age at 1st birth: this exists as TAGE_FB

* marital status at 1st birth: not 100% sure. TYEAR_FB is year of first birth. we also have first and current marriage year. HOWEVER, if divorced, do not have that information. Would need to merge with SSA supplement

* educational attainment: use EEDUC
recode eeduc (31/38=1)(39=2)(40/42=3)(43=4)(44/46=5), gen(educ)
label define educ 1 "Less than HS" 2 "HS Diploma" 3 "Some College" 4 "College Degree" 5 "Advanced Degree"
label values educ educ

drop eeduc

* subsequent birth: can use TCBYR* to get year of each birth, so will get a flag if that occurs during survey waves.

* partner status: can use ems for marriage. for cohabiting unions, need to use relationship codes. will recode this in a later step (may already happen in step 4)
	* need to code as like year status, did they lose a partner at all, add one, in that year - need to think about this more

* employment change: use rmesr? but this is the question around like # of jobs - RMESR is OVERALL employment status, but then could have went from 2 jobs to 1 job and still be "employed" - do we care about that?! also put with hours to get FT / PT?
	* also use ENJFLAG - says if no-job or not

recode rmesr (1=1) (2/5=2) (6/7=3) (8=4), gen(employ)
label define employ 1 "Full Time" 2 "Part Time" 3 "Not Working - Looking" 4 "Not Working - Not Looking" // this is probably oversimplified at the moment

* earnings change: tpearn seems to cover all jobs in month. need to decide if we want OVERALL change in earnings, or PER JOB (<5% of sample has 2+ jobs) - less hard than i thought...

* wages change: Was going to try to aggregate across but it is seeming too complicated, so will handle in annualization, with any wage change, as well as shift from how paid (e.g. hourly to annual salary)
// EJB*_PAYHR* TJB*_ANNSAL* TJB*_HOURLY* TJB*_WKLY* TJB*_BWKLY* TJB*_MTHLY* TJB*_SMTHLY* TJB*_OTHER* TJB*_GAMT*

* hours change: do average tmwkhrs? this is average hours by month, so to aggregate to year, use average?
